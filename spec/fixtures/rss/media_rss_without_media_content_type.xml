<p>The U.S. Geological Survey, in collaboration with many partners, recognizes <a href="http://www.ngwa.org/events-education/awareness">National Groundwater Awareness Week</a>: March 9-15, 2014.</p>
<p><a href="http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/ngwaw/2014.html">USGS National Groundwater Awareness Week website</a></p>
<p><strong>What’s so special about groundwater?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_192371" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/files/2014/03/crosssec.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-192371" src="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/files/2014/03/crosssec-300x176.jpg" alt="Diagram of Groundwater" width="300" height="176" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Diagram showing how precipitation water soaks into the ground and, depending of the layers of rock below ground, can take from days to millennia to get back into surface waters.

<p>Groundwater is one of the Nation&#8217;s most valuable natural resources. It supplies the drinking water for nearly half our nation’s population and provides about 40 percent of our irrigation water.  It sustains streamflow between precipitation events and during protracted dry periods. And it helps maintain a variety of aquatic ecosystems that are dependent on groundwater discharge to streams, lakes, and wetlands. As the Nation&#8217;s principal reserve of freshwater, it represents much of the potential future water supply.</p>
<p><strong>Groundwater: right underneath our feet</strong></p>
<p>Groundwater is an essential part of most of our daily lives. Rural farmers and urbanites, water-supply managers and regulators, researchers and policy-makers — all have a part to play in the current status and future of our groundwater resources. This valuable resource is right underneath our feet.</p>
<p>While groundwater can be found nearly everywhere, its availability varies. Groundwater is stored in aquifers, a resource shared by many users. Aquifers receive water deposits from precipitation and surface water. If there are too many users making too many withdrawals from an aquifer — say, to irrigate farmlands, water lawns, or supply wells — and the deposits don’t keep up with the demand, there may not be enough groundwater to go around.</p>
<div id="attachment_192381" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/files/2014/03/sprinkler.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-192381" src="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/files/2014/03/sprinkler-300x208.jpg" alt="Groundwater" width="300" height="208" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In many states, groundwater is a vital source of irrigation water for farmers. USGS photo.</p></div>
<p>Even when groundwater is plentiful, it’s not truly available unless the quality is acceptable for the intended use. Both water quantity and quality are essential to maintaining water supply for municipal, domestic, agricultural, and recreational use, and for aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>USGS and groundwater</strong></p>
<p>At the USGS we systematically observe and monitor groundwater conditions at locations across the United States. USGS groundwater assessments help inform the public so that citizens across the nation can engage in best practices for management, protection, and conservation. Groundwater conservation is a matter of both conserving the quantity and protecting the quality from contamination.</p>

USGS photo.</p></div>
<p>USGS scientists work constantly to improve our understanding of how groundwater moves through the subsurface and what human and natural factors affect the quantity and quality of that groundwater. Understanding these dynamics helps answer important questions about current groundwater availability and long-term sustainability.</p>

<p>Fundamental knowledge of the land and its resources is a basic need for effective government and a productive economy in any nation.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), celebrating its 135th birthday on March 3rd, serves our Nation by providing reliable scientific information that can be used in many different ways: to describe and understand the Earth; to minimize loss of life and property from natural disasters; to manage water, ecosystem, energy, and mineral resources; and to enhance and protect our quality of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A legacy of science for the Nation</strong></p>
<p>Using science to understand our natural heritage is at the core of the USGS. It can even be traced in our pre-history. More than 200 years ago, the first government survey of the natural resources of the American West, Lewis and Clark&#8217;s Corps of Discovery (1804-06), was commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson and funded by Congress. In carrying out Jefferson&#8217;s detailed instructions in regard to cartography and scientific goals, the explorers mapped every twist and turn of the Missouri and the Columbia rivers, gathering information about the soils, plants, animals, and native inhabitants of the lands through which they passed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_192071" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/files/2014/02/NationalMap.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-192071" src="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/files/2014/02/NationalMap-300x172.jpg" alt="National Map" width="300" height="172" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The National Map is a collaborative effort among the USGS and other Federal, State, and local partners to improve and deliver topographic information for the Nation. USGS image.</p></div>
<p>In 1867, shortly after the Civil War ended, Congress authorized the first of a series of major western explorations that were led by Clarence King (USGS first director), F. V. Hayden, George Wheeler, and John Wesley Powell (USGS second director). On March 3, 1879, the 45th Congress and President Hayes agreed to promote governmental economy and efficiency by discontinuing the three ongoing geological and geographical surveys and replacing them with a U.S. Geological Survey.  They made the new organization responsible for the scientific &#8220;classification of the public lands and examination of the Geological Structure, mineral resources and products of the national domain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through 135 years the USGS has evolved from a small group of scientists and surveyors who provided guidance on how to describe and manage the public lands of the West to a leading Federal science agency that conducts research and assessment activities on complex natural resource and science issues at scales ranging from local to global.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Survey today</strong></p>
<p>The institutional strength of the modern USGS is the broad array of science expertise we have. The USGS operates programs that include natural hazards research, such as our earthquake, volcano, and landslide programs; a network of 8,000 streamgages that monitor water availability and help in forecasting floods; and other programs that investigate invasive species, wildlife disease, and climate change.</p>
<p>We have nearly 9,000 science and science-support staff at work at more than 400 USGS science centers across the Nation. The USGS leverages its resources and expertise in partnership with more than 2,000 agencies of State, local and tribal government, the academic community, other Federal partners, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector.</p>
<div id="attachment_192081" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/files/2014/02/Snake.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-192081" src="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/files/2014/02/Snake-300x200.jpg" alt="Python" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">USGS scientists investigate invasive species. Here biologists remove a python from the Everglades for further study and electronic tagging. USGS photo.</p></div>
<p>The Survey does not manage any land or resources or have regulatory responsibilities. Our priority is our “boots on the ground” scientists who work with sophisticated monitoring networks to study our world and its natural processes. Our entire focus is on providing objective, ready-to-work science that decision-makers need to face difficult, multi-faceted issues.</p>
<p>The Survey conducts vital resource assessments for energy and mineral potential. We also conduct research on the environmental and human health impacts of the production and use of various energy resources. The USGS is the sole Federal source of scientific information and research on nonfuel mineral potential, production, and consumption, as well as on the environmental effects of the extraction and use of mineral resources. To support the development of economic and national security policies in a global context, the USGS collects and analyzes data on essential mineral commodities from around the world.</p>
<p>USGS maintains the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) whose mission is to rapidly determine the location and size of all destructive earthquakes worldwide and to immediately disseminate this information to concerned national and international agencies, scientists, and the general public.</p>
<p>We’re the largest civilian mapping agency. Furthermore, we continuously observe the Earth through the Landsat satellite program in partnership with NASA. The latest satellite, Landsat 8, launched in February 2013, has performed spectacularly in its first year in space.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>With historical data comes increased perspective</strong></p>
<p>Historical datasets that have been meticulously collected and archived by the Survey provide a critical context for the current state of natural systems as well as for discerning human influences on the environment.  Some of these long-term USGS datasets include borehole temperature records in Alaskan permafrost; streamgage readings for over a century in several locations; over four decades of global change observations from Landsat satellites; catalogs of historical earthquakes and historical data from the Global Seismic Network; and paleoclimate records gleaned from ice cores and seafloor samples.</p>
<p>With historical records like these, in combination with cutting-edge research in paleogeology and chemical analysis, USGS scientists can look far back in time — across decades and centuries, in some instances; in other cases, even millions of years — to understand the global climate conditions of a certain age. This wealth and breadth of data provides an invaluable framework for understanding climate and environmental changes that are taking place today.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Data in demand</strong></p>
<p>Public demand for USGS scientific findings and data is strong and growing stronger. The <a href="http://www.iea.org/">International Energy Agency</a> has said of us, “The most widely respected source of information on global conventional oil and gas resources is the U.S. Geological Survey.” A May 2012 article in <a href="http://www.academia.edu/2504128/Top-cited_articles_in_environmental_sciences_Merits_and_demerits_of_citation_analysis">a respected international journal</a> found that the U.S. Geological Survey is the most cited institution in the world<strong> </strong>for environmental science.</p>
<p>Other broad sectors of the public and the emergency response community have come to rely on USGS for timely, robust, reliable hazard information. For example, USGS supplies rapid assessments of earthquake fatalities and economic losses; real-time flood inundation mapping to support emergency response; predictions of coastal impacts from hurricanes 48 hours prior to hurricane landfall; debris-flow susceptibility maps; rapid notification of the onset of a volcanic eruption at high-threat volcanoes; and real-time wildfire condition information to support fire fighters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The road ahead</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_192101" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/files/2014/02/SaltonSeaScience.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-192101" src="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/files/2014/02/SaltonSeaScience-225x300.jpg" alt="Salton Sea Sediment Quality" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A USGS scientist monitors sediment quality in the Salton Sea of California. USGS studies toxic contaminants in the environment to better understand their effects on fish, wildlife, and human health. USGS photo.</p></div>
<p>The National Academy of Sciences released a <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13302" target="_blank">rigorous review</a> of the importance of international programs at USGS in 2012. The Academy concluded, “A global, integrated understanding of the Earth sciences is of fundamental importance to enhance U.S. public health and security, safeguard our natural heritage, and support economic development. …. As the Nation’s leading, integrated Earth science agency, the [USGS] has a significant role to play in contributing information and knowledge to address Earth science issues arising in and beyond U.S. national boundaries.”</p>
<p>Today, with the world population at more than 7 billion and projected to grow to 9 billion by 2040; with competing priorities to balance – for the economy, for the environment, for public health and safety; with the serious, perhaps irreversible consequences of climate change and sea-level rise to consider, our leaders need scientific information about the land and its resources that they can trust with the greatest confidence to guide their decisions.</p>
<p>Building on a rich heritage of 135 years of impartial science for the Nation, the USGS looks forward to applying the breadth and depth of its scientific capabilities, along with the determined commitment of its employees, to the challenges ahead.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, Shakespeare’s character famously said. No question there. We can all agree on that, sweet Juliet.</p>
<p>How would Juliet’s naming logic apply to places? A place by any other name would certainly still exist. But, with a different name or multiple names, how could that place be readily identified? How could it be found?</p>
<p>Geographic names, the reference words we use for particular places, are among the most elementary and organic parts of language. Even a prehistoric man needed to use distinctive names to tell to his family and friends where he found berries or crossed the river. In modern societies, geographic names have many more uses and complexities.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s have standards, please</strong></p>
<p>As more and more people at greater and greater distances have a reason to refer to a particular place, the potential for confusion rises if that place has different names or the same name is used for different places. There have to be widely-accepted standards for the vast number of geographic names we have access to so that each name can be used reliably on maps and in official documents. Some authoritative organization has to set standards for the spelling and application of geographic names so they can be used consistently as commonly understood references in government, commerce, and everyday life.</p>

<p>Consider the alternative. Without systematic standards for geographic names, we wouldn&#8217;t be able to use them routinely in digital environments. We wouldn&#8217;t be able to find places in an instant on mobile devices and see their correct location on electronic maps.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://geonames.usgs.gov/">U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN)</a> is the interagency organization established to maintain uniform geographic name usage throughout the federal government. It provides the official place names required by law for use in federal government publications, including maps, web sites, and documents. The standardized spelling and use of geographic names allows the federal government to communicate clearly and unambiguously about places, reducing the potential for confusion.</p>
<p>While the Board’s authority only applies to the federal government, the Board’s decisions and its standards of use for geographic names are almost always followed by state and local governments and by commercial organizations. The BGN does not initiate naming or renaming actions. It responds to proposals received from Federal agencies; State, local, and Tribal governments; and the public.</p>
<p>The usefulness of standardizing geographic names is well proven, even if it is often taken for granted. The United Nations actively supports international standardization of geographic names by encouraging strong programs of national standardization. More than 50 nations have some type of national names authority.</p>
<p><strong>The origin of the Board and its work</strong></p>
<p>Following the surge of exploration and settlement of the Western territories and Alaska after the American Civil War, inconsistencies among many names, spellings, and applications became a serious problem to surveyors, map makers, and scientists who required uniform geographic nomenclature. Accordingly, President Benjamin Harrison signed an Executive Order on Sept. 4, 1890, establishing the Board and giving it authority to resolve unsettled geographic names questions. He named Dr. Thomas Corwin Mendenhall, Superintendent of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, as its first chairman.</p>

<p>Two of the Board’s earliest decisions from its first meeting in 1890 illustrate its continuing goal of name standardization. The Board decided on the official spelling of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Bering</span> Sea (not <em>Behring, Behrings, Kamchatka</em>) in Alaska and on official recognition of the name of the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Anacostia River</span> (not <em>Eastern Branch</em>) in Washington, D.C. The disallowed spellings and name usages were preserved in the official record of Board decisions as variant (not official) names for reference purposes, just as they are today. <em></em></p>
<p>The Board gradually expanded its interests to include foreign names and other areas of interest to the United States, a process that accelerated during World War II.</p>
<p>The 1947 public law that established the U.S. Board on Geographic Names in its current form directs the Board to operate conjointly with the Secretary of the Interior. The Board is composed of representatives appointed from six cabinet-level departments (Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, Interior, and State), as well as the Central Intelligence Agency, the Government Printing Office, the Library of Congress, and the U.S. Postal Service.</p>
<p><strong>One Board, two committees</strong></p>
<p>Working through two permanent committees — a Domestic Names Committee and a Foreign Names Committee — the BGN standardizes geographic names worldwide for federal use, including domestic names, foreign names, and names for oceans, seas, and undersea features as well as features in Antarctica. The Secretary of the Interior has final review and approval of BGN actions.</p>
<p>The work of the Foreign Names Committee concerns standardization of foreign geographic names for publications and communications of the U.S. federal government; it has no role in establishing geographic name standards or usage in other countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Determining the official names of features in foreign areas can be complicated.  A feature may be located in multiple countries that have different languages or names for that feature, or a feature may be located in a single country with multiple languages. For instance, the Danube River, which flows through or borders ten countries, has seven names with different spellings which are approved for use in U.S. federal publications.</p>
<p>The U.S. Geological Survey, as the premier domestic mapping agency in the federal government, provides staff support for processing BGN domestic geographic names decisions and polices. Similarly, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in the Department of Defense provides staff support for processing foreign geographic names. However, the BGN is not under and does not report to either the USGS or NGA.</p>

<p><strong>The significance of names</strong></p>
<p>Beyond the practical considerations of maps and databases, geographic names are important to every citizen’s sense of place.</p>
<p>“Geographic names are keys to stories and insight about our world,” said Douglas Caldwell, a researcher at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and current BGN chair. “We often use names without thinking much about them, but if we look just a little deeper, we see they are a window on our history and our natural environment.”</p>
<p>When a geographic name controversy is brought to the Domestic Names Committee, the most important factor in the Board’s decision is established local usage. The Board’s goal, within very broad limits of name standardization, is to have the official name reflect the name that the local community actually uses.</p>
<div id="attachment_191871" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/files/2014/02/SnowHorse1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-191871" src="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/files/2014/02/SnowHorse1-300x157.jpg" alt="Snow Horse Ridge" width="300" height="157" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Board of Geographic Names approved the name Snow Horse Ridge in Utah in 2013.

<p>Geographic names often carry great cultural significance. For the Foreign Names Committee, using one name in preference to another can even have political implications. For this reason, foreign geographic names are considered carefully and reflect the official policy of the U.S. government.</p>
<p><strong>Accessing geographic name records</strong></p>
<p>U.S. Board on Geographic Names databases and other resources are available from the <a href="http://geonames.usgs.gov/">Board’s home page</a>. The web site provides access to all BGN place name resources through queries to the Board’s on-line databases, as well as download capabilities for larger place name files.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/">Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)</a> is the source of official and variant names for domestic features. Geographic names for foreign areas are found at the <a href="http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/index.html">GEOnet Names Server (GNS)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Board on Geographic Names approves and standardizes geographic names for the federal government. The Board’s decisions involve names for domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea features. As a coordinating body that works with the Secretary of the Interior, the Board reduces duplication of work, personnel, and authority among agencies. The Board has promoted clear and effective communication throughout the federal government for more than 120 years.</p>
