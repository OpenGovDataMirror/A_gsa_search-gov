          <media:text><![CDATA[72 of the Defense Department’s best active-duty golfers competed&nbsp; at the Armed Forces Men’s and Women’s Golf Trials Monday and Tuesday. Half made it through the trials and move on to the 4-day championship round beginning Thursday.<br />
<br />
Randolph Oaks golf course is hosting the competition; that’s a first for Randolph and it’s also the first time the services’ trials and championship have been at one location.<br />
<br />
Doug Quirie, “Mainly it was a financial issue. We’re trying to figure out a way to save money; to keep the program going. By doing this we were able to save a substantial income.” RT :10<br />
<br />
This year is also unique because the best six men and two women will represent the U.S. during an international tournament in Bahrain next week.<br />
<br />
As for now, it’s anyone’s guess as to who will make up the 2014 Armed Forces Team.<br />
<br />
Doug Quirie, “Our top two players from previous years are not here.&nbsp; And there’s some awful good golfers from all four services here this year. So to be honest, it’s wide open.&nbsp; This really is the first time in a long time there’s really a chance for everybody to compete and everybody to win.” RT :16<br />
<br />
Team members will be announced Sunday, as will the winner of this week’s event, earning one service branch bragging rights for a year. Deb Decker, Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph Public Affairs.]]></media:text>

          <media:text><![CDATA[MSgt Traci Meduna, 59th Med Wing Inspection Team Manager<br />
Lorenzo Cruz, 502nd Comm Sqdn<br />
<br />
SB – Meduna: “We’re exercising our public health emergency – or POD – our point of dispensing – where if there’s an emergency within on base or within the city and we need to vaccinate people very quickly we would set up our POD and make sure that happens.”<br />
<br />
SB – Cruz: “I’m a volunteer but I’m going to be getting a shot too so both at the same time.”<br />
<br />
SB - Meduna:&nbsp; “The role players are always outstanding. Some of them are very excited to be doing this.”<br />
<br />
SB - Meduna: “We have packages that have all the equipment we need. So as soon as they get notification to stand up the POD all they have to do is load that equipment in a truck and bring it to the POD location.”<br />
REPORTER OFF CAMERA - “Are you afraid to get the shot?”<br />
<br />
SB – Cruz: “I don’t call it afraid but kind of reluctant…yes, afraid.”<br />
<br />
SB - Meduna: “Everyone is from the 59th Med Wing. We have our pharmacy team chief who is responsible for the operations. We have our mental health. We have our immunizations team. Security. Manpower. And we operate as a mini clinic.”<br />
<br />
SB – Cruz with immunization tech: “Ouch.” “Did it really hurt?” “No, it didn’t hurt.”<br />
<br />
SB – Meduna: “Anything could happen. A new flu strain could send us into setting up our POD operations or just needing to treat individuals very quickly.”]]></media:text>
